        "# Epoxy Resistivity Data\n",
        "The data below comprises of 7 different epoxy candidates for integration in fusing an ASIC substrate to pervoskite single crystal. Resistivity is the first critical point of focus as it relates directly to device performance. Secondly, the selected candidate will need to undergo a series of spin coating experiments in hopes of developing a method to control the thickness of the epoxy. The viscosity of the epoxy is an important factor, but not as serious as the electrical behavior of the epoxy. Plots below show the measured resistivity and include the forward and reverse sweep for positve and negative 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 volts.\n",

        "All measurments were set to source voltage and measure current. The measurement range was fixed to 10nA witha voltage range set to 200V along with a limit set to 10.5nA. The script and manual measurements differed in the time intervals in which the observed current was recorded. Script measurements were taken after 15 minutes while most of the manual data was recorded after 3 minutes.  \n",
