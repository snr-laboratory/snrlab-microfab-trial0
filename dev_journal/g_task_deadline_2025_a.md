# Journal for tasks and deadlines

This journal documents tasks, assigned deadlines, and actual completion dates. Its purpose is to restore and strengthen a disciplined, task-oriented mindset in Gumaro Gonzalezâ€™s research practice. Too much time has already been lost without tangible progress. Henceforth, large objectives must be broken down into smaller, concrete tasks, each with a clear deadline. These deadlines are to be respected without exception, so that progress toward Ph.D.-level work becomes steady, visible, and accountable.
