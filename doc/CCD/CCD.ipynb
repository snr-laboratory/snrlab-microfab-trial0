        "The CCD is part of a class of charge-transfer device structures widely used for image sensors. CCD image sensors are made of MOS capacitor arrays which have the functions of light-to-charge (photon-to-electron) conversion, charge integration, charge transfer, and charge-to-voltage conversion. The basis of the CCD is the dynamic storage and withdrawal of charge in a series of MOS capacitors.\n",

If we assume there are no external connections to the semiconductor, then this diffusion process cannot continue indefinitely. As electrons diffuse from the n region, positively charged donor atoms are left behind. Similarly, as holes diffuse from the p region, they uncover negatively charged acceptor atoms.\n",
