        "The CCD is part of a class of charge-transfer device structures widely used for image sensors. CCD image sensors are made of MOS capacitor arrays which have the functions of light-to-charge (photon-to-electron) conversion, charge integration, charge transfer, and charge-to-voltage conversion. The basis of the CCD is the dynamic storage and withdrawal of charge in a series of MOS capacitors.\n",
