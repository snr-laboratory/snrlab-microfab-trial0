# **CCD Basics**

Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are fabricated using semiconductor processes to optimize light detection and charge transfer. Their manufacturing involves precise control of silicon properties, doping profiles, and optical structures to achieve high quantum efficiency and low noise. Below is a detailed analysis of CCD fabrication based on current research and industrial practices:

## **CCD Operation**

1) Charge Generation/Storage
- Within a pixel: the photoelectric effect. Incoming photons strike the silicon withing a pixel and are easliy absorbed if they possess the correct wavelength (energy). Photons of energy 1.1eV (Si band gap -> Absorption -> Promotion of valence e-) to ~4eV generate single electron-hole pairs. 
- Once e- have been freed to the conduction band of the silicon, they must be collected and held in place until readout occurs. 
- Each pixel acts as a MOS capacitor. An applied voltage on the gate creates a depletion region, forming a potential well, to trap electrons. 

2) Charge Transer
- By sequentially clocking voltages on adjacent gates, electrons are shifted from one pixel to the next.

## **Fabrication Plan**

- CCD detector design: high-resistivity n-type silicon substrate. Metal contacts for controlling potential wells. A very thin layer of Al2O3 (optional:SiO2 or SiN) for achieving uniform and flat features at this specific interface.
- Skipper features to allow multiple non-destructive measurements of the same charge packet.
-  
 
## **n-type High-Resistivity Silicon Substrates**
- Rationale: For weak-signal searches (WIMPs, neutrinos), n-type substrates are superior due to their deep depletion, back-illumination, and ultra-low noise. However, fabrication is more complex and can be costly.

### **Buried Channel Design**
This creates an electric field that confines electrons to the bulk silicon, away from the surface. 
- Created via phosphorus ion implantation to form an n-doped region within the p-type epitaxial layer[^1][^6].
- Advantages: Higher charge transfer efficiency (CTE > 0.99999) and reduced surface recombination compared to surface-channel designs[^1][^7].
- Implant: Phosphorus @ 150 keV (1e16 cm⁻³) to form n-type layer 1.5 μm below surface.
- Annealing: 900°C, N₂ ambient to activate dopants without oxidizing gates.
The n-type doped layer creates a buried channel where electrons flow. This keeps electrons ~1-2 μm away from the Si-SiO₂ interface, preventing interaction with oxide traps.
  
### **Reasoning** 
The n-type layer creates a potential minimum in the silicon bulk. Electrons are repelled from the surface by built-in electric fields from doping gradients and positive gate voltages that push electrons deeper into the silicon.
- Sub-electron Noise: BCCDs achieve 0.068 e⁻ rms/pixel with Skipper readout, enabling single-electron resolution critical for rare-event detection.
- Cryogenic Compatibility: BCCDs paired with ALD-grown Al₂O₃ passivation reduce dark current to <0.001 e⁻/pixel/hour at -100°C, essential for long-exposure dark matter searches.
- Radiation-Hardened Architectures: BCCDs using epitaxial silicon (10 kΩ·cm) and hydrogen annealing tolerate displacement damage from neutron/γ-ray backgrounds in underground labs.

- Advantages: Higher charge transfer efficiency (CTE > 0.99999) and reduced surface recombination compared to surface-channel designs[^1][^7].

## **Materials and Substrate Preparation**

CCDs are typically fabricated on **high-resistivity silicon substrates** (10,000–12,000 Ω·cm) to enable deep depletion regions (200–300 μm) for improved near-infrared response[^2][^7]. Two primary approaches exist:

- **p-type substrates**: Used for traditional front-illuminated devices with epitaxial silicon layers (≈20 µm thick)[^1][^8].
- **n-type substrates**: Enable back-illuminated, fully depleted CCDs by applying bias voltages to deplete the entire wafer thickness[^2][^6].

Key steps include:

- **Epitaxial growth**: A lightly doped p-type or n-type layer is grown to form the photoactive region[^1][^6].
- **Gettering**: In-situ doped polysilicon layers on the wafer backside reduce impurities and dark current[^2][^9].

### **Substrate and Passivation**
- Material: Float-zone Si (200 mm, 10 kΩ·cm, p-type) for deep depletion (~300 μm).
- ALD Passivation: 50 nm Al₂O₃ on backside + SiO₂/SiN frontside stack for QE >90% (UV/VIS) .

### **Gate Architecture**

- **Triple polysilicon gates**: Patterned using plasma etching (Cl₂/HBr) to create phase-shifted electrodes for charge transfer[^2][^6].
- **Gate insulator**: 500 Å SiO₂ + 500 Å Si₃N₄ for improved dielectric properties[^2][^7].


### **Channel Isolation**

- **LOCOS process**: Creates oxide-based channel stops to prevent cross-talk between pixels[^1][^6].
- **p+ implants**: Underlie channel stops to further confine charge packets[^1].

## **Fabrication Process Steps**

1. **Wafer preparation**: High-resistivity silicon wafers are cleaned and polished[^2][^7].
2. **Ion implantation**: Defines buried channels and transistor regions[^6][^9].
3. **Gate oxide growth**: Thermal SiO₂ combined with LPCVD Si₃N₄[^2].
4. **Polysilicon deposition**: Three layers deposited and etched to form transfer gates[^6][^8].
5. **Metallization**: Aluminum-silicon contacts for interconnects[^2].
6. **Backside processing** (for back-illuminated devices):
    - Thin doped polysilicon layer + indium tin oxide (ITO) for ohmic contact[^2][^7].
    - Bonding to glass support wafers followed by silicon handle removal[^5][^6].

## **Back-Illumination Techniques**

- **Thinning**: Traditional CCDs are thinned to ≈20 µm but suffer from fringing at near-IR wavelengths[^2][^3].
- **Full depletion**: Achieved via backside bias (≈40 V) on high-resistivity substrates, enabling:
    - **Broadband QE**: >80% from 400–900 nm[^2][^6].
    - **Reduced fringing**: Thick (200–300 µm) depletion minimizes interference[^2][^7].
- **Anti-reflection coatings**: Optimized for specific wavelength ranges (e.g., SiO₂/Si₃N₄ stacks)[^5][^7].
