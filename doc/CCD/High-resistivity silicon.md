# High-resistivity silicon substrates (10,000–12,000 Ω·cm) - enable deep depletion regions (200–300 μm) 

Deep depletion regions in CCDs refer to **thick, fully depleted semiconductor layers** (200–300 μm) where an electric field exists to efficiently collect photogenerated charges. High-resistivity silicon (10,000–12,000 Ω·cm) is required to achieve this because:

## **Physics of Deep Depletion**

1. **Depletion Mechanism**
When a bias voltage is applied, mobile charges (electrons/holes) are removed from the silicon, creating a charge-free zone with an electric field.

    - **Depletion depth** scales with $\sqrt{\rho \cdot V}$, where $\rho = \text{resistivity}$ and $V = \text{applied voltage}$[^2][^4].
    - High resistivity ($\approx 10^4\ \Omega\cdot\text{cm}$) allows deep depletion (200+ μm) at moderate voltages (≈40 V)[^4].
      
3. **Role of High Resistivity**
    - Low doping ($\sim 10^{12}\ \text{cm}^{-3}$) reduces ionized impurities, enabling:
        - **Longer Debye length**: Electric fields penetrate deeper.
        - **Lower full-depletion voltage**: $V_{\text{dep}} \propto \rho^{-1}$[^2][^4].
    - Standard silicon ($\rho \sim 10\ \Omega\cdot\text{cm}$) limits depletion to ≈10 μm[^1][^4].

## **Advantages in CCD Performance**

- **Near-Infrared Response**:
Photons at 1000 nm penetrate ≈100 μm into silicon. Deep depletion ensures charges generated at these depths are collected, boosting quantum efficiency (QE) to >35% at 1000 nm[^1][^4].
- **Reduced Charge Diffusion**:
Strong lateral electric fields confine charges to pixels, improving spatial resolution[^1][^4].
- **Fringing Mitigation**:
Thick depletion minimizes interference patterns caused by multiple reflections in thin CCDs[^4].

## **Trade-offs and Design Considerations**

- **Dark Current**:
Non-MPP (multi-pinned phase) operation in deep-depletion CCDs increases dark current, necessitating cryogenic cooling[^1][^5].
- **Manufacturing Complexity**:
Requires specialized processes like backside ohmic contacts (e.g., in-situ doped polysilicon + ITO) for back-illuminated designs[^4].

In summary, high-resistivity silicon enables deep depletion by balancing moderate bias voltages with thick, fully active regions-critical for scientific CCDs in low-light, near-infrared applications like astronomy and spectroscopy[^1][^4][^5].
