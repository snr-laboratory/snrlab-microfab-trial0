## **LAr-CCD Detector**

The proposed detector layered architecture consists of a silicon substrate base, metal gate electrodes, a 50 nm aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) layer deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD), and liquid argon as the detection medium. There is an external electric field being applied to this detector so if ionization in LAr creates free electrons they will drift towards the Al2O3 surface/interface. This device is inspired and mimics the charge coupled device operation.

## **Operation**

A fundamental operating principle of the device involves using the gate electrodes to establish and manipulate “potential wells” within the liquid argon volume. When a potential is applied to one gate electrode, capacitive coupling generates a “potential well” in the LAr that attracts and confines negative charges. By modulating the potentials on adjacent electrodes, you create penetrating electric fringing fields that allow for controlled lateral charge transfer between wells. The success of this approach depends critically on the quality of the LAr/Al₂O₃ interface, as this boundary mediates the coupling between the electric fields generated by the gate electrodes and the charges within the liquid argon.

**Questions**

1. How severe is recombination in LAr and if significant how to overcome recombination losses in LAr

2. Potential Well Creation : Are these actually potential wells like those formed in the CCD in Si substrate or these localized electric field gradients? 
  - By applying carefully controlled voltages to the segmented electrodes, we create localized electric field gradients (potential wells) at the semiconductor surface. These potential wells are designed to trap and confine the arriving ionization electrons, analogous to the potential wells in a silicon CCD.

5) Liquid Argon Integration

## **Measurement Strategy**

In principle, this device should work. However, the issue lies in the charge transfer efficiency (CTE) which is heavily dependent on the charge trapping due to defects on the Al2O3 surface. The wetting behavior also plays a role in CTE. The wetting characteristics of any liquid-solid system are quantified through contact angle measurements, where angles below 90° indicate favorable wetting conditions and angles above 90° suggest poor wetting behavior. The theoretical foundation for understanding argon wetting behavior rests on Young's equation, which describes the equilibrium contact angle as a balance between solid-vapor, liquid-vapor, and solid-liquid interfacial tensions.

Techniques to detect and quantify surface charge trapping at the LAr/Al₂O₃ interface:

1) Multifrequency C-V Characterization

When charges get trapped, they can't follow rapid voltage changes. At high frequencies, trapped charges appear "frozen" and don't contribute to capacitance. At low frequencies, they have time to respond, creating measurable differences in capacitance values. Frequency-dependent capacitance changes indicate trap presence  and larger differences between high and low frequency measurements mean more trapping.

Use frequency sweeps from 10 kHz to 1 MHz at cryogenic temperatures (87K). This technique effectively separates different trap types:

- Border traps: Respond at lower frequencies, cause accumulation region dispersion

- Interface traps: Respond at higher frequencies, affect inversion/depletion regions

- Extract the frequency-dependent capacitance values from the accumulation region

- The dispersion in these values indicates border trap presence

- Numerical Fitting Process - The equation is solved numerically by guessing an initial Nbt value

- Calculating the theoretical capacitance using the differential equation for each measured frequency

- Comparing calculated vs. measured capacitance across the frequency range

- Iteratively adjusting Nbt until the best fit is achieved

Cryogenic C-V Setup

- Perform measurements from room temperature down to LAr operating temperature (87K)

- Use the distributive border trap model to extract border trap density (equation 1):

First Term (γ²/jωE_ox): Represents the pure oxide capacitance contribution - how the electric field propagates through the dielectric without trapping effects.

Second Term (q²N_bt ln(1+jωτ)/τ): Represents the border trap contribution - how trapped charges affect the total admittance. The logarithmic term captures the frequency-dependent response of traps at different depths.

2) Hysteresis Analysis for Trap Quantification
Sweep voltage from negative to positive, then back again, while measuring capacitance to measure charge trapping/release. If there were no trapping, the forward and reverse sweeps would perfectly overlap. The separation between these curves (hysteresis) directly indicates how many charges got trapped. Equation (2) converts the voltage shift into actual trapped charge density:
- Apply voltage sweeps from accumulation to depletion and reverse
- Calculate trapped charge density from hysteresis magnitude (equation 2):

- Nit = Trapped charge density (cm−2)
- Cox = Oxide capacitance per unit area (F/cm2)
- ΔVFB = Flat-band voltage shift (V)
- q = Elementary charge (1.6×10−19 C)

**Recent studies**
On Oscura skipper-CCDs have revealed that trap characteristics are more closely linked to fabrication batch rather than specific gettering methods, suggesting that process control and equipment contamination play crucial roles in determining final device performance.

## **Electrical Interface Considerations**

The efficiency of charge transfer depends critically on the quality of the electrical interface between the liquid argon and the aluminum oxide surface. When liquid argon completely wets the alumina surface, it forms intimate molecular-level contact across the entire interface area, eliminating air gaps or void spaces that could act as electrical barriers or field distortion sources

Non-wetting conditions, conversely, would result in the formation of contact line discontinuities, trapped gas regions, and potentially unstable interface geometries. These features introduce several mechanisms that degrade charge transfer efficiency: increased interface resistance due to reduced contact area, field distortions caused by dielectric discontinuities, and potential charge trapping sites.

## **Field Uniformity and Distribution**

Uniform electric field distribution is essential for predictable and efficient charge transfer operations. The electric field lines must penetrate consistently into the liquid argon to create well-defined potential wells and enable controlled charge movement between adjacent gate electrodes. Wetting conditions support uniform field distribution by maintaining a constant dielectric interface without geometric discontinuities that could distort field lines

Designing the device to promote and maintain wetting conditions at the liquid argon/alumina interface can be achieved through several approaches: ensuring that the aluminum oxide surface is clean and properly prepared before assembly, maintaining high purity in the liquid argon to prevent contamination that could alter wetting properties, and potentially applying surface treatments to the alumina layer that enhance wetting without compromising electrical properties.

## **Cryogenic Liquid Wetting Characteristics**

Research on cryogenic liquid wetting indicates that most cryogenic fluids, including liquid argon, exhibit strong wetting tendencies on solid surfaces. Experimental measurements have shown that cryogenic liquids typically produce contact angles well below 90° on most surfaces, with the highest measured contact angles being approximately 30°. This natural wetting tendency results from the low surface tension of cryogenic liquids relative to the surface energy of most solids.
