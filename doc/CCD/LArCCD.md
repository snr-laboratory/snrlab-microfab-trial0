## **LAr-CCD Detector**

The proposed detector layered architecture consists of a silicon substrate base, metal gate electrodes, a 50 nm aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) layer deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD), and liquid argon as the detection medium. There is an external electric field being applied to this detector so if ionization in LAr creates free electrons they will drift towards the Al₂O₃ surface/interface. This device is inspired and mimics the charge coupled device operation.

## **Operation**

A fundamental operating principle of the device involves using the gate electrodes to establish and manipulate “potential wells” within the liquid argon volume. When a potential is applied to one gate electrode, capacitive coupling generates a “potential well” in the LAr that attracts and confines negative charges. By modulating the potentials on adjacent electrodes, you create penetrating electric fringing fields that allow for controlled lateral charge transfer between wells. The success of this approach depends critically on the quality of the LAr/Al₂O₃ interface, as this boundary mediates the coupling between the electric fields generated by the gate electrodes and the charges within the liquid argon.

**Questions**

1. How severe is recombination in LAr and if significant how to overcome recombination losses in LAr

2. Potential Well Creation : Are these actually potential wells like those formed in the CCD in Si substrate or these localized electric field gradients? 
  - By applying carefully controlled voltages to the segmented electrodes, we create localized electric field gradients (potential wells) at the semiconductor surface. These potential wells are designed to trap and confine the arriving ionization electrons, analogous to the potential wells in a silicon CCD.

Material Selection and Process Flow:
1) Substrate should be Si since it is the industry standard.
- Consider buying SiO₂ on Si wafer to isolate the metal from the bulk Si. Without SiO₂, applying voltage to a metal electrode with direct contact with silicon will result in having to driving current flow through the substrate (ie limited voltage handling and possible device breakdown).

## **Measurement Strategy**

In principle, this device should work. However, the issue lies in the charge transfer efficiency (CTE) which is heavily dependent on the charge trapping due to defects on the Al₂O₃ surface. The wetting behavior also plays a role in CTE. The wetting characteristics of any liquid-solid system are quantified through contact angle measurements, where angles below 90° indicate favorable wetting conditions and angles above 90° suggest poor wetting behavior. The theoretical foundation for understanding argon wetting behavior rests on Young's equation, which describes the equilibrium contact angle as a balance between solid-vapor, liquid-vapor, and solid-liquid interfacial tensions.

Measurement Plan: 
- Multifrequency C–V characterization to distinguish between border and interface traps.
- Hysteresis analysis for quantifying trapped charge density.
- Cryogenic contact angle measurements to assess wetting

Instrument: Semiconductor Characterization System (ex: Keithley 4200 SRS)

[Gate Dielectric Capacitance-Voltage Characterization Using the Model 4200 Semiconductor Characterization System](https://scientific-devices.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gate-Dielectric-Capacitance-Voltage-Characterisation.pdf)

Techniques to detect and quantify surface charge trapping at the LAr/Al₂O₃ interface:

1) Multifrequency C-V Characterization

When charges get trapped, they can't follow rapid voltage changes. At high frequencies, trapped charges appear "frozen" and don't contribute to capacitance. At low frequencies, they have time to respond, creating measurable differences in capacitance values. Frequency-dependent capacitance changes indicate trap presence  and larger differences between high and low frequency measurements mean more trapping.

- Interface Traps: High Dit (interface trap density) suggests poor ALD surface passivation or contamination during fabrication.
  - Mitigation: Refine pre-ALD cleaning (e.g., UV ozone treatment) or post-deposition annealing.
- Border Traps: Elevated Nbt (border trap density) indicates bulk oxide defects.
  - Mitigation: Adjust ALD parameters (e.g., precursor purge time, temperature) to improve film quality.

Use frequency sweeps from 10 kHz to 1 MHz at cryogenic temperatures (87K). This technique effectively separates different trap types:

- Border traps: Respond at lower frequencies, cause accumulation region dispersion

- Interface traps: Respond at higher frequencies, affect inversion/depletion regions

- Extract the frequency-dependent capacitance values from the accumulation region

- The dispersion in these values indicates border trap presence

- Numerical Fitting Process - The equation is solved numerically by guessing an initial Nbt value

- Calculating the theoretical capacitance using the differential equation for each measured frequency

- Comparing calculated vs. measured capacitance across the frequency range

- Iteratively adjusting Nbt until the best fit is achieved

Cryogenic C-V Setup

- Perform measurements from room temperature down to LAr operating temperature (87K)

- Use the distributive border trap model to extract border trap density (equation 1):

<img width="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/974646af-5ed5-43df-b353-e9cf87337d73" />

First Term (γ²/jωE_ox): Represents the pure oxide capacitance contribution - how the electric field propagates through the dielectric without trapping effects.

Second Term (q²N_bt ln(1+jωτ)/τ): Represents the border trap contribution - how trapped charges affect the total admittance. The logarithmic term captures the frequency-dependent response of traps at different depths.

[A Distributed Model for Border Traps in Al2O3 − InGaAs MOS Devices](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/Faculty/rodwell/publications_and_presentations/publications/2011_4_april_yuan_EDL.pdf)


2) Hysteresis Analysis for Trap Quantification
Quantify net trapped charge density (Nit) via flat-band voltage shifts (ΔVFB) during gate voltage sweeps. Sweep voltage from negative to positive, then back again, while measuring capacitance to measure charge trapping/release. If there were no trapping, the forward and reverse sweeps would perfectly overlap. The separation between these curves (hysteresis) directly indicates how many charges got trapped. Equation (2) converts the voltage shift into actual trapped charge density:
- Apply voltage sweeps from accumulation to depletion and reverse
- Calculate trapped charge density from hysteresis magnitude (equation 2):

<img width="141" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf563aa0-7177-4636-9c91-b4e263a315be" />

- Nit = Trapped charge density (cm−2)
- Cox = Oxide capacitance per unit area (F/cm2)
- ΔVFB = Flat-band voltage shift (V)
- q = Elementary charge (1.6×10−19 C)

Voltage Sweep:
- Forward sweep: Accumulation (-V) → Inversion (+V)
- Reverse sweep: Inversion (+V) → Accumulation (-V)
- Rate: 0.1–0.5 V/s (slow enough for traps to respond)
- Temperature: 87K (cryogenic conditions mimic operational environment)

Trap Type Discrimination
- Border Traps: Cause symmetric hysteresis (similar ΔV_FB in both sweep directions)
- Interface Traps: Lead to asymmetric hysteresis (larger ΔV_FB in forward sweeps)

## **Recent studies**
On Oscura skipper-CCDs have revealed that trap characteristics are more closely linked to fabrication batch rather than specific gettering methods, suggesting that process control and equipment contamination play crucial roles in determining final device performance.

3) Wetting/Non Wetting - Cryogenic Sessile Drop Contact Angle Measurement
Quantify the contact angle of liquid argon (LAr) on Al₂O₃ to assess interfacial wetting quality, which directly impacts electric field uniformity and charge transfer efficiency (CTE). Fabricate Al₂O₃ coated silicon substrates using identical ALD conditions as the detector.
- Place the substrate in a temperature-controlled cryostat filled with purified liquid argon/xenon.
- Use a piezoelectric picoliter dispenser to deposit a  noble liquid droplet onto the Al₂O₃ surface.
- Capture droplet profile via high-speed camera with backlit illumination through a cryostat viewport.
- Calculate contact angle using Young-Laplace equation fitting.

Field Uniformity
- θ <30° (full wetting) ensures uniform electric field penetration into LAr, critical for stable potential well formation.
- θ >90° (non-wetting) creates field distortions, increasing charge trapping and CTE loss.
Interface Quality
- Low θ correlates with minimal interfacial defects (e.g., voids, contaminants)
  
Deviations from θ targets indicate ALD process issues (e.g., carbon contamination, non-uniform growth).
Post-annealing (300–500°C) can improve θ by 5–10° via hydroxyl group removal.

## **Intermediate Measurements**
To ensure that the manufacture the LAr-CCD device proceeds smoothly and achieves the desired outcomes, it is essential to incorporate additional metrology and inspection steps during fabrication. These measurements will help detect process deviations early, maintain high device yield, and ensure that the final device meets performance and reliability targets.

Thin-Film Thickness and Uniformity (Dielectric and Metal Layers)
- Ellipsometry and X-ray Reflectivity (XRR): after ALD deposition of Al₂O₃ and after metal gate deposition to verify that thickness and uniformity are within specifications.

Critical Dimension (CD) and Overlay Metrology
- CD-SEM/SEM (Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscopy): After lithography and etching of gate electrodes, measure line widths, gate spacing, and overlay accuracy to ensure pattern fidelity and alignment between layers

Surface and Interface Quality
- Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM): Assess surface roughness of the silicon and Al₂O₃ layers after cleaning and deposition. Excessive roughness can increase trap densities and degrade device performance
- Four-point probe or resistivity measurements: After metal deposition, check for proper conductivity and absence of breaks in gate electrodes.

## **Electrical Interface Considerations**

The efficiency of charge transfer depends critically on the quality of the electrical interface between the liquid argon and the aluminum oxide surface. When liquid argon completely wets the alumina surface, it forms intimate molecular-level contact across the entire interface area, eliminating air gaps or void spaces that could act as electrical barriers or field distortion sources

Non-wetting conditions, conversely, would result in the formation of contact line discontinuities, trapped gas regions, and potentially unstable interface geometries. These features introduce several mechanisms that degrade charge transfer efficiency: increased interface resistance due to reduced contact area, field distortions caused by dielectric discontinuities, and potential charge trapping sites.

## **Field Uniformity and Distribution**

Uniform electric field distribution is essential for predictable and efficient charge transfer operations. The electric field lines must penetrate consistently into the liquid argon to create well-defined potential wells and enable controlled charge movement between adjacent gate electrodes. Wetting conditions support uniform field distribution by maintaining a constant dielectric interface without geometric discontinuities that could distort field lines

Designing the device to promote and maintain wetting conditions at the liquid argon/alumina interface can be achieved through several approaches: ensuring that the aluminum oxide surface is clean and properly prepared before assembly, maintaining high purity in the liquid argon to prevent contamination that could alter wetting properties, and potentially applying surface treatments to the alumina layer that enhance wetting without compromising electrical properties.

## **Cryogenic Liquid Wetting Characteristics**

Research on cryogenic liquid wetting indicates that most cryogenic fluids, including liquid argon, exhibit strong wetting tendencies on solid surfaces. Experimental measurements have shown that cryogenic liquids typically produce contact angles well below 90° on most surfaces, with the highest measured contact angles being approximately 30°. This natural wetting tendency results from the low surface tension of cryogenic liquids relative to the surface energy of most solids.

### Multifrequency C–V Characterization: Probing Interface and Border Traps

- A semiconductor characterization system applies a DC bias to the gate electrode while superimposing a small AC signal (10 kHz–1 MHz). Capacitance is measured as a function of gate voltage at multiple frequencies under cryogenic conditions (87 K).
  - "superimposing" means that the semiconductor characterization system applies both a DC voltage and a small AC voltage signal to the gate electrode at the same time. The DC bias sets the steady-state operating point or condition for the device, while the small AC signal is added on top of this DC voltage to probe the device’s response to small, dynamic changes
  - The purpose is to measure how the device responds to small perturbations (AC signal) at different operating points (DC bias)

### Hysteresis Analysis: Quantifying Trapped Charge Dynamics
- Reversible trapping: Symmetric hysteresis → Border traps dominate (charge release matches capture)
- Asymmetric hysteresis: Interface traps preferentially capture carriers in one sweep direction
- Batch-dependent variations: Observed in Oscura CCDs, linking trap densities to fabrication contamination

### Microphysics 

**Traps disrupt band bending by introducing localized charges, modifying the electric field.**
**Connect the CVU HI to the gate electrode and CVU LO to the LAr bulk**

LAr as a "Pseudosubstrate":
- Unlike traditional MOS capacitors (where capacitance is between gate and silicon), your LAr-CCD measures capacitance between the gate and LAr. This requires redefining "accumulation" and "depletion" in terms of LAr’s quasi-free electrons.

Interface Trap Response:
- The AC signal at CVU HI excites interface traps at the Al₂O₃/LAr boundary. The CVU LO detects their delayed response (phase shift), allowing extraction of trap density (Dit)

Interface traps (Dit) 
- Arise from defects at the LAr/Al₂O₃ interface (e.g., dangling bonds, impurities).
- Act as recombination centers, reducing charge transfer efficiency (CTE)
- Quantified using the Terman method
[Comparison of methods to quantify interface trap densities at dielectric/III-
V semiconductor interfaces](https://escholarship.org/content/qt0nf6t24x/qt0nf6t24x.pdf)

Border traps
- Located within the Al₂O₃ bulk, these traps exchange charge with LAr via tunneling.
- Modeled by a distributed RC network (eq 1)

This condition is achieved by applying a negative voltage to the gate which  raises the band diagram on the left-hand side.

### C-V Measurements
The C-V measurements are widely used to quantitatively study the MOS structures. There are three important parameters in evaluating high-k dielectrics on novel channel materials:
- The first is the amount of C-V hysteresis when the MOS capacitor is biased well into accumulation and
inversion region.
- The second is the interface trap density Dit showing the quality of surface passivation and dielectric formation.
- The third is the frequency dispersion on accumulation capacitances and the subsequent flat-
band shifts.

### **Fundamentals of MOS C–V Measurements**

#### Capacitance in MOS Structures

- Capacitance ($C$) measures charge storage per unit voltage ($C = Q/V$).
- MOS Structure:

$$

($\varepsilon_{Al_2O_3}$: permittivity, $A$: gate area, $t_{ox}$: oxide thickness).
- Depletion Capacitance:

$$
C_{dep} = \frac{\varepsilon_{LAr} \cdot A}{W_{dep}}
$$

($W_{dep}$: depletion width in LAr).
- Total Capacitance (Depletion):

$$
\frac{1}{C} = \frac{1}{C_{ox}} + \frac{1}{C_{dep}}
$$
