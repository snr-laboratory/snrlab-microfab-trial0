# Sequence for Fabricating CCD 

---

## **Standard CCD Fabrication Sequence**

The conventional process for fabricating scientific CCDs involves the following core steps:

1. **Wafer Preparation**
    - High-resistivity silicon wafers are cleaned and polished[^2][^6][^8].
2. **Deposition**
    - Thin films (such as gate oxides and dielectrics) are deposited, often using thermal oxidation or chemical vapor deposition[^6][^8].
3. **Photolithography**
    - Patterns for gates, channels, and other structures are defined using photolithographic masks[^1][^6][^8].
4. **Etching**
    - Unwanted material is removed to form the desired features[^1][^6][^8].
5. **Ion Implantation**
    - Doping is performed to create buried channels, channel stops, and transistor regions[^2][^6][^8].
6. **Annealing**
    - Heat treatment activates dopants and repairs crystal damage[^6].
7. **Polysilicon Deposition**
    - Multiple layers of polysilicon are deposited and patterned to form the transfer gates (often using a three- or four-phase process)[^2][^4][^8].
8. **Metallization**
    - Aluminum or aluminum-silicon alloy is deposited and patterned to form electrical contacts and interconnects[^2][^8].
9. **Passivation**
    - Protective layers are added to shield the device from contamination and environmental effects[^8].
10. **Backside Processing (for back-illuminated devices)**
    - The wafer is thinned, the back surface is passivated (often with a p+ layer), and antireflection coatings are applied for optimal quantum efficiency[^2][^6].

## **Novel and Emerging Fabrication Sequences**

Recent innovations in CCD fabrication focus on improving performance, yield, and integration with other technologies:

### **1. Advanced Lithography and Etching**

- Use of finer lithography and more precise etching allows for higher pixel density and smaller feature sizes, increasing resolution and reducing sensor size[^3][^7].


### **2. Multi-Phase Polysilicon Gate Processes**

- A novel four-step polysilicon deposition process improves yield on lower-precision processing lines, as described in CN102201346A[^4]. This method reduces short-circuit risk between layers and is particularly useful for manufacturing small-pixel CCDs with high yield (up to 70–80%)[^4].


### **3. Fully Depleted, Thick Substrate CCDs**

- Fabrication on ultra-high-resistivity silicon (10,000–12,000 Ω·cm) with back-biasing enables depletion depths of 200–300 μm, greatly enhancing near-infrared sensitivity and quantum efficiency[^2].


### **4. CCD-in-CMOS Hybrid Technology**

- Integration of CCD charge storage and transfer structures within a CMOS process ("CCD-in-CMOS") enables ultra-fast burst mode imaging and combines the benefits of both technologies (high speed, high sensitivity, and on-chip integration)[^5].


### **5. Microlens Arrays and Pinned Photodiode Structures**

- Addition of microlens arrays increases fill factor and light sensitivity, while pinned photodiode technology (originally from CMOS) is being adapted to CCDs to further reduce noise and improve low-light performance[^3][^7].
