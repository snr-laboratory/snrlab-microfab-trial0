# Description of the Terms and Conditions for the Necessary Requirements for Dissertation Completion under Dr. Yuan Mei

The work to be completed under Dr. Yuan Mei for acceptable dissertation work consists of two components. However, the trial project must be delivered as it is a fundamental step in continuing the work outlined below (i.e. be able to bond the chip to a glass interposer using some form of bond bumping and conductive medium (e.g. ACF)):

1. Be able to fabricate several individual open gate field effect transistors in Si which can be used as sensors based on already existing and mature methods. Demonstrate that they work and confirm through intense measurement methods (e.g. highly controlled measurement apparatus that eliminates or removes any unwanted interference).

2. Be able to manufacture field effect transistors in Si which can be used to potentially detect single photons or ions using novel methods. Demonstrate the working principle results, whether it works or not. If the fabricated device is not able to perform as desired, then perhaps we can describe the limits of detection for the decided upon FET type (e.g. bridge transistor).

It is important to note that fabrication is only a small portion of the interest of this intended work. The meat and potatoes lie in the ability to be able to carry out highly intentional and robust measurements which will require the construction of well designed measurement apparatuses. In addition, this project will entail a great deal of self-learning regarding electrical engineering and RF sensitive measurement analysis. 

#### Key words: Quantum limit, single photon/ion detection, bridge transistor (not fixed), FET, glass interposer, charge sensor.
