# Ph.D. Research Plan and Expectations

Advisor: Dr. Yuan Mei  
Graduate Student: Gumaro Gonzalez

## Purpose

This document outlines the expectations, scope of work, and requirements for the successful completion of a doctoral dissertation under the guidance of Dr. Yuan Mei.  It establishes  milestones, defines the student’s and advisor's responsibilities, and fosters mutual understanding throughout the Ph.D. journey.  This plan is specifically tailored for Gumaro Gonzalez to address his unique research objectives while aligning with broader academic standards.  While not exhaustive, it is intended to reflect the spirit of the expectations and agreements and may be revised through mutual consent.

## Scope of Dissertation Work

The dissertation work focuses on advancing sensor technologies by integrating CMOS circuit chips with novel materials.  The student holds ultimate responsibility for the projects, including selecting, executing, and delivering them.  The advisor is responsible for providing necessary resources, guidance, and ensuring the maintenance of quality standards throughout the research process.

The research must contain two primary elements:

### 1. Pushing the boundary of fundamental sensing mechanism

In the quest to improve electron, photon, ion, and chemical sensing at the quantum limits, new sensing mechanisms are required.  Finding a new mechanism and demonstrating its viability is the core of this element.  Laboratory-grade device fabrication and a successful demonstration of the sensing mechanism with the device and control+measurement apparatus are expected.

As a candidate project, a possible innovation in single ion sensing is to produce a FET transistor bridge with AC modulation and lock-in signal processing to repeatedly interrogate the ion-induced signal on the gate of one of the FETs.

Other mechanisms shall be explored before committing to one for deep investigation.

### 2. Producing industrial-quality prototype sensors

This element aims to produce industrial-quality ("usable in the real world") sensors using understood sensing mechanisms and devices.  Engineering problems shall be the primary problems to solve when creating high-quality sensors.

As a candidate project, X-ray and UV imagers can be created by hybridizing materials and CMOS circuit chips.  In the process, primary integration problems are at the interface between materials and CMOS chips.

## Additional Focus Areas

It is important to note that fabrication is only a small portion of the interest of this intended work. The meat and potatoes lie in the ability to be able to carry out highly sensitive and robust measurements which will require the construction of well designed measurement apparatuses and detailed data analysis.  In addition, this project will entail a great deal of electrical engineering, including RF measurements and analysis.

**Key words: Quantum limit, single photon/ion detection, bridge transistor (not fixed), FET, glass interposer, charge sensor.**
