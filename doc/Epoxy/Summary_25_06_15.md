# Epoxy Summary 
The data below comprises of 9 different epoxy candidates for fusing an ASIC substrate to pervoskite single crystal. The brands include JBWeld, Gorilla Glue, EPO-TEK and TotalBoat. Resistivity is a critical determinant of selection as it relates directly to device performance. The selected epoxy will need to undergo a series of spin coating experiments for developing a method to control the thickness of the epoxy. Plots below detail the current and resistivity and include the forward and reverse sweep for 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 volts.

All measurments were set to source voltage and measure current. The measurement range was fixed to 10nA with a voltage range set to 200V along with a limit set to 10.5nA. The script and earlier manual measurements differed in the time intervals in which the observed current was recorded. Script measurements were taken after 15 minutes while most of the manual data was recorded after 3 minutes.

- EPO-TEK 301: Highest measured resistivity: 9.4E+15 Ω·cm and lowest measured current across all voltages (best insulator).
- JB Weld: Very low resistivity: 9.2E+11 Ω·cm (poorest insulator)
- MG Chemicals 832HD: Measured resistivity matches very well with actual resistivity
- EPO-TEK 353ND: 2nd best measured resistivity within actual resistivity range
- Gorilla Glue script and manual measurements match very well. Range of resistivity: E+11-E+15 Ω·cm
- TotalBoat products show very similar behavior.

## Resistivity vs Voltage for Manual Method 
Plot showing the resistivity for possible candidates using manual data collection as well as mostly no degassing and different time intervals (ie wait time for stable measurement). The TotalBoat latest products were degassed.

- MPTB: Highest measured resistivity: 4.6E+14 Ω·cm (lower than script, but still highest in this set)
- MG Chemicals 832HD and EPO-TEK 353ND show the best resistivity matching with TDS
- JB Weld:Very low resistivity: 9.2E+11 Ω·cm Range of resistivity: E+11-E+14 Ω·cm
- Manual measurements show more scatter and slightly lower resistivity values than script data, but the ranking/order of materials is mostly consistent.
- Discrepancy in EPO-TEK 301
