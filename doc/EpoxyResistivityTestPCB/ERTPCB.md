#  Epoxy Resistivity Test on Printed Circuit Board

## Plan is to create a KiCad design for bulk resistivity epoxy test measurments as well as epoxy resistivity when placed on a surface that mimics the chip features (Application Specific Integrated Circuit Si-CMOS chip). On a single PCB board we plan to test the resistivity of an epoxy under different surface conditions before we move on to the actual chips themselves. Our hope, is to fuse a single pervoskite crystal on top of the epoxy if we can manage to come up with a method to apply a controllably thin layer of an epoxy that must also match the resistivity of the Si substrate (adding a graphite filler to epoxy).
