# Initial Keithley Resistance Tests

## Objective 
To be able to collect data in the expected range of the given epoxies (i.e 10^12-15 ohm-cm range). Use the smu and configure the proper settings to best measure such high resistances. 

## Water Resistance Measurements
Settings on smu were set to source current and measure resistance. Key observations:
* The compliance voltage of 5 V is insufficient for most of your source current settings when measuring a high-resistance sample like water.
* Negative resistance and current values suggest measurement instability due to hitting its limits.
* At very low currents (e.g. 10 nA), the instrument provides more stable measurements but with significant fluctuations due to noise or environmental interference.
