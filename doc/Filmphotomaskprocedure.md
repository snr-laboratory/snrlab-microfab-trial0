# Film Transparency Photolithography Procedure 
To meet the trial project requirements by the end of January, which I will do, here is the following procedural steps I will take to produce the laser printed negative photomask pattern on a glass slide and confirm good adhesion of deposited metal traces. 

# Procedure:
1. Laserprinting Photomask
   * Clean transparency slides well with IPA and dry off with kimwipes
   * Play with printer settings to get the best printing results of photomask design
   * Align transparencies well and if need be, print the design multiple times to get a nicely printed mask that meets inspection requirements (i.e fully opaque lines and well defined - there should not be any light passing through that could interefere with desired exposure)
   * Once this is achieved, cut out the mask (roughly 5x5cm for ease of handling)
   * Repeat this process two more times and obtain three reliable masks and store in containers
   * Clean work area
     
   * expected time: ? (should be a quick process if all goes well)
  
**Before moving forward, the following insruments will be reserved ahead of time:**
* Aligner
* E-Beam Evaporator 


2. Piranha Clean of Glass Slides
   * Prepare H2SO4 + H2O2 3:1 concentration solution enough to submerge the glass substrate
   * DI Sonication for 5 minutes
   * Rinse with DI and N2 dry
   * Note: The hydroxylation process is essential for obtaining good adhesion between resist and substrate
  
3. Spin Coating
   * Set-up hot-plates - one @ 150C and another @ 100C  
   * Clean substrate with 5 min Acetone sonication and then a 5 min IPA sonication and N2 dry
   * Place substrate on hotplate to remove any residual Acetone/IPA (~1 min)
   * Place substrate in wafer box and allow to cool (wait ~20sec before placing in wafer box)
   * Obtain resist (NR9-1000PY) and disposable pipettes
     
   * Input the following recipe: 
       * 500rpm, 100rpm/s, 5s
       * 3000rpm, 1000rpm/s, 60s
       * 0rpm, 1000rpm/s, 0.1s
   * Continue to spin coat if desire results are not achieved (i.e uniform coating with no or very little imperfections - drag marks can be on the outskirts of susbstrate but nowhere near the center. If this happens simply remove resist using acetone and repeat spin coating procedure)
  
   *
