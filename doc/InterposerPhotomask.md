# Project Plans for Interposer Photomask

## Create a photomask for interposer

# Interposer Photomask Considerations

## Window
* Optimal ledge distance (materials property calculation vs literature review search)
* How will the window size affect the integrity of the glass interposer?
* Should the window dimensions be determined by CSA region (cover region with no CSA) or are there benefits in explosing the whole chip surface.

## Interconnects
* Pitch for interconnect pads
* Shape and size of interconnect pads
* The distance between interconnects and chip edge and between Au ball bumping region and interconnects
    * To close to edge introduces issues with resist uniformity or increased probablity of mishandling the device (avoid near edge). 

## Zebra Connectors
* Pitch (150 micron)

## Transmission (Trace) Lines 
* Width
* Length
* Thickenss
* Line spacing and design

## Materials
* Quartz vs Sapphire Interposer
    * Need for specific dielectric consideration?
