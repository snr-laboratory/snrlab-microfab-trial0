# Update on Glass Interposer Photomask

## Updates and Questions

* Trace lines were modified to 80um

* Working on the outer connects (contact pads for Zebra Connectors)

## Questions 

1) Last we spoke you mentioned to keep the 2500um trace lines and then to connect/extend those to the zebra connectors contact pads. Should we keep the same width regarding the trace lines going from the already existing trace lines to the zebra connectors contact pads

2) For material, should we keep everything Au?

3) Still unsure about the width of the zebra connectors. You had mentioned 150um and according to Fujipoly it is an available standard size. Was there a reason for this width?

4) Plain type vs support zebra connectors? Do we need to consider supports for the zebra connectors?
