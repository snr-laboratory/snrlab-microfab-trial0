# Interposer Photomask Fabrication Plan 

## Fabricating a photomask using a laser printer and transparancies 
* [Soft photolithography mask](https://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-reviews/soft-lithography-microfabrication/su-8-photolithography-photomask/)
* This is a possibility since most of the feature sizes are quite large (i.e 80um - second smallest feature size)
  * ## **Alignment markers at the corners of the window, that match chip features, have concerning dimensions**

**The alignment markers may need to be modified since they are very near to resolution limitations**   

## Laser Printer
The Hybrid Atelier at UTA has the Brother HL-L8360CDW series printer with the following specs:
* Resolution: Up to 2400 x 600 dpi **(~21um)**
* Supported Media Sizes:
  * Minimum: 3 x 5 inches (76.2 x 127 mm)
  * Maximum: 8.5 x 14 inches (215.9 x 355.6 mm)

## Material Selection
Transparencies need to be robust (i.e compatibility, transparency (UV light transmission), adhesion, warping, etc...)
  1) 3M CG3300 Transparency Film - **toner sprays may be necessary**
  * [Project: Improved LaserJet PCB transparencies](https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/project-improved-laserjet-pcb-transparencies.12474/)   
  2) Premium Transparency Film 5 Mil - **not fully transparent**
  3) Caseys Laser Film - **Casey's Ultra Black spray can be used to improve toner opacity and UV blocking**

## Ink selection?

## Fabricating a photomask using a laser printer and transparancies with a twist
  * Print an enlarged version (e.g 8x bigger) (if 1:1 ratio does not work) and use optical projector/lens reduction system to make the image smaller
  * Concerns:
    * Alignment or precise projection of image
    * Avoiding distortions or loss of detail
    * Optical setup
