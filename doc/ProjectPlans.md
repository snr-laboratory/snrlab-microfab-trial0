# Work Plan

## 1. Meeting to Discuss PhD Collaboration and Roles
## 2. Interposer and Transistor Project 
* ### Interposer and ACF (top priority)
  * Au solder spheres - separation distance, application (ball bonder: [this is a link](https://shimadzuinstitute.org/centers/nanotechnology-research-center/nanotechnology-research-center-dicing-and-bonding-platforms/) ) and creating a level height platform between all Au spheres and interposer/gold trace metal contact (thermal sonicator press instrument)
  * Incorporating ACF (tape/press vs instrument)
  * Sapphire or quartz interposer
  * The 1st chip to be considered is manufactured in sky130 process through efabless.  Chip GDS can be found [here](https://github.com/AustinMcDonald/Q-Pix-Sky130-Caravel/blob/main/gds/caravel_fullchip_transplanted.oas).
 
* ### Individual Field Effect Transistors (not a priority)
  * Mask designs (size and separation distance of transistors)
  * Metals, insulators and doping  
  * Exposed gate oxide 

## 3. Cleanroom Access 
* ### Currently trained and have access for the following tools:
  * OAI Model806 manual Front/Backside Contact Mask Aligner [this is a link](https://shimadzuinstitute.org/centers/nanotechnology-research-center/nanotechnology-research-center-photolithography-platforms/) 
  * AJA ATC ORION Series Evaporation System [this is a link](https://shimadzuinstitute.org/centers/nanotechnology-research-center/nrc-deposition/) 
  * AJA ATC ORION Series UHV Sputtering System
  * Technics Macro-RIE Series 8800 Plasma System [this is a link](https://shimadzuinstitute.org/centers/nanotechnology-research-center/nanotechnology-research-center-etching-and-ashing-platforms/) 
  * AXIC JetFirst 150 Rapid Thermal Anneal [this is a link](https://shimadzuinstitute.org/centers/nanotechnology-research-center/nanotechnology-research-center-furnace-platforms/) 
  * Zeiss Supra 55VP Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope [this is a link](https://shimadzuinstitute.org/centers/nanotechnology-research-center/nanotechnology-research-center-characterization-platforms/)
  * Gaertner L116S300 Stokes Ellipsometer
  * KLA-Tencor P-6 Profilometer

* ### Short-term goal:
  * Resolve PhD status and re-gain access to fabrication tools and cleanroom. Determine Au solder sphere application after further reviewing physical chip. Find a reliable method for ACF application and establish gold/metal trace contact. Select and determine a method for incorporating sapphire or quartz interposer which requires a small window be cut from the material. Develop a robust fabrication procedure for the interposer for IC packaging.
