# 832 Results

The graph displays the measured resistivity of your epoxy sample as a function of the sourced voltage, for both positive and negative voltage sweeps. Here’s a detailed interpretation:

---

## **Key Observations**

### **1. Positive Voltage Sweep (0 to +200 V)**

- **Trend:** Resistivity increases gradually from about $4.6 \times 10^{12}$ Ω·cm at +25 V to $1.08 \times 10^{13}$ Ω·cm at +200 V.
- **Behavior:** The increase is relatively smooth and consistent, indicating stable dielectric behavior under positive bias.


### **2. Negative Voltage Sweep (0 to -200 V)**

- **Trend:** At -25 V, resistivity is exceptionally high ($1.19 \times 10^{14}$ Ω·cm), then drops sharply as voltage magnitude increases, settling around $8.8 \times 10^{12}$ Ω·cm at -200 V.
- **Behavior:** The resistivity decreases with increasing negative voltage, and the values converge toward those seen in the positive sweep at high voltage magnitude.


### **3. Asymmetry Between Positive and Negative Bias**

- **At low voltages,** resistivity is much higher for negative bias compared to positive.
- **At higher voltages** (|V| ≥ 100 V), resistivity values for both polarities become similar, around $10^{13}$ Ω·cm.

## **Physical Interpretation**

- **Polarity Dependence:** The pronounced difference between positive and negative voltage sweeps at low voltages suggests possible asymmetry in the electrode interfaces, trapped charges, or polarization effects within the epoxy material.
- **Interface Effects:** High resistivity at low negative bias may indicate barrier formation or charge trapping at one electrode, which is overcome as voltage magnitude increases.
- **Material Quality:** The convergence of resistivity at high voltages for both polarities supports that the bulk epoxy dominates conduction at higher fields, while interface or surface effects are more significant at low voltages.

---

## **Experimental Notes**

- **Log Scale:** The y-axis is logarithmic, emphasizing large changes in resistivity.
- **Data Quality:** The measured current standard deviations are low, indicating stable and reliable measurements.
- **Setup:** The area and thickness used for resistivity calculation are 11.6964 cm² and 0.18 cm, respectively[^2].

## **Summary Table**

| Voltage (V) | Resistivity (Ω·cm, +V) | Resistivity (Ω·cm, –V) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 25 | $4.61 \times 10^{12}$ | $1.19 \times 10^{14}$ |
| 50 | $6.42 \times 10^{12}$ | $1.81 \times 10^{13}$ |
| 100 | $8.26 \times 10^{12}$ | $1.15 \times 10^{13}$ |
| 150 | $9.70 \times 10^{12}$ | $9.34 \times 10^{12}$ |
| 200 | $1.08 \times 10^{13}$ | $8.80 \times 10^{12}$ |

## **Conclusion**

- **Epoxy shows high resistivity** (good insulation) overall.
- **Significant polarity dependence** at low voltages points to interface or charge trapping effects.
- **At higher voltages,** resistivity becomes more symmetric and stable, reflecting bulk material properties.

If you are troubleshooting, focus on electrode preparation, possible contamination, or inhomogeneities in the epoxy layer, as these can cause the observed asymmetry at low voltages[^2].
