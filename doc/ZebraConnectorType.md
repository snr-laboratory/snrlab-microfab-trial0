# Zebra Connectors for Glass Interposer and PCB (FR-4)

## Zebra GOLD 8000 Connectors

## Specifications:

* 100-166 pitch options

* Series 8000 C

  * 0.025mm x 0.076mm flat wire on 0. 15mm center-to-center spacing (Min. 166 wires/inch.)
    
    * Conductive Width: 25 um
      
    * Insulative Width: 125 um
   
    * Pitch (Center-to-Center): 150 um
   
    * High Density 

* Solid self-supporting connectors - better stability???

 ## Design Considerations

* Pitch Matching: 150um Type C to 80um gold trace lines (glass interposer)

  * 80um gold trace lines and 25um conductive width

*  Contact Pad Width (glass interposer)

  * larger than 25um conductive width (80um - matching trace?) 

  * Pad Pitch: Center-to-center spacing of pads matches the 150 um (Center-to-Center) pitch
